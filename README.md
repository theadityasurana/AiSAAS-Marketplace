The Perplexity of AI tools — find the perfect AI startup for your needs, just by describing what you’re looking for.

🔍 AI Discovery Engine – The Perplexity for AI Startups

Description

This project is an intelligent AI startup discovery engine — built to help users find the perfect AI tool, product, or service just by describing their needs in plain English. Think of it as Perplexity for AI tools — a natural language interface that lets users skip the noise and surface the most relevant AI solutions across domains like sales, marketing, design, productivity, automation, and more.

It bridges the growing disconnect between the explosion of AI-based startups and the fragmented discovery experience users face. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of directories, Product Hunt posts, or outdated blogs, users can now just say what they need — like “I need an AI sales assistant under $30/month” or “a voice AI for booking appointments” — and get instant, tailored recommendations.

The system supports dual-facing access:
	•	Client Interface: End users can search, filter by budget, use case, integration, pricing model, and more.
	•	Startup/Company Interface: Founders and AI tool creators can onboard their tools, define use cases, pricing tiers, and optimize for discovery through semantic matching.

🚀 Vision

Our mission is to democratize access to the right AI tools — faster, simpler, and smarter. As the AI ecosystem explodes, we aim to become the first stop for discovering AI solutions — whether you’re a solopreneur, agency, enterprise, or developer.

We believe this platform solves the arbitrage of AI discovery — unlocking distribution for startups, while giving users an intelligent, intuitive way to find tools that truly fit their needs.
